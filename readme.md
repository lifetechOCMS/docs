## üõ† Introduction  
Lifetech OCMS is a PHP framework designed with security, modularity, and performance in mind. It includes:  
- **DDM Encryption**: Secure deployment by encrypting source code.  
- **LW-Token System**: Secure authentication.  
- **Modular Structure**: Separate themes, modules, and plugins.

## üîπ Core Features  
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture**  
- **Data Defacing Model (DDM) for Security**  
- **LW-Token System for Authentication**  
- **Maplite Query Builder for Database Operations**  
- **Custom Jlon Data Format**  
- **Frontend Flexibility (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)**

## ‚ö° Installation & Running 
1. **Download via GitHub**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lifetechOCMS/lifetechocms.git
2. **Installing via Composer**  
   ```sh 
   composer create-project lifetechocms/lifetechocms "your-project-name"
## Running the application locally
1. locate your folder terminal
   ```sh
   php lt start
if you want specific port number then 
    ```sh
      php lt start "your-port-number"
## üì¶ Importing in LifetechOCMS

LifetechOCMS uses a custom import function called ltImport() to load files such as models, helpers, or other PHP resources from a module. This keeps modules self-contained and promotes a clean architecture.

üß† Syntax
```
ltImport('ModuleName', 'FileName.php');
```

üîç Example
```
ltImport('mdPosProduct', 'TbProduct.php');
```

This will load the TbProduct.php file from the models/ directory of the mdPosProduct module.

üìÅ Import Target Order

The import system checks the following folders within a module:

models/

based/

controllers/

views/ (for helper PHP files, not templates)

If the file exists in any of these, it will be included.

üí° Best Practice

Always ensure your filenames match exactly, including case.

Avoid using the same filename in multiple folders of a module.
